# Google Meet Automation

Hey there, this whole pandemic situation has made everyone attend so many video conferences and mainly online classes is so boring. For those who use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/) will have a clear idea on how much time it takes for you to look out for a link and turn of the audio and video devices and then wait for the host to accept you. I just figured a way wherein you just need to mention your meeting link and it will take care of the rest whilst you are sipping :coffee:.

### Prerequisites

- [Selenium Driver](https://www.selenium.dev/)
- [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

## Steps

1. Download the code and open in your local IDE.
2. Change your credentials in [keys.py](GoogleMeetAutomation/keys.py) file. You can choose to export these credentials into your virtual environment.
3. Don't forget to add your chrome driver path in [main.py](GoogleMeetAutomation/main.py) file
4. Click on run and add the meeting link when prompted and hit join now button.
